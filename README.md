# SliceItAll Prototype
 The game "Slice It All!" prototype 

  States Description : 
States names basically came from knife's rotation on scene. 
If knifes tip looking up thats mean knife is in UpState, if looking left is LeftState.


 Slice Mechanic Description :
I used actually real sliding mechanic like lightsaber instead of more basic ways like objectpooling and istantiate at certain position since i did not have sliceable objects models before slicing and after slicing. So whatevery object is there with sliceable.cs in it, knifes can slide any direction.
